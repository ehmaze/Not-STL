This is my Not-STL, where I make slight modifications to STL methods that are suited to my liking.

Fibonacci Priority Queue:
-Default ctor: O(1)
-Copy ctor: O(n)
-Move ctor: O(n)
-Overloaded assignment: O(n)
-push: O(1)
-top: O(1)
-size: O(1)
-empty: O(1)
-decrease_key: O(1)
    Pass in a value in the priority too, and the "lesser" value you want it to be promoted to.
